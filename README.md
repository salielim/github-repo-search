# GitHub Repo Search
Single page JavaScript application that allows one to search Github.com for repos by keyword.
HTML, CSS, jQuery.

## Overview
Write a single page JavaScript application that allows one to search Github.com for repos by keyword.
There is no one way to complete this exercise as long as the minimum requirements are met.


## Application
Write your javascript code in app.js
The results should be shown in "owner/name" format
When a result is clicked, show the repo's 'language', 'followers', 'url', and 'description'
Solution does not need to support older browsers, but should work in the latest version of Chrome
Feel free to use any libraries or tools you like.
Your app (and code) should be performant and the UI/UX should be intuitive. Not a lot of effort is required for the UI design but it should be reasonably pleasant to look at.

## Git
Your process is just as interesting as the final product, so please do leave a basic git history
Your git commit messages should tell us a story

## Bonus Questions - Optional
1) Let's say we told you your app needs to search yet another repository, together with Github. What considerations will you make when update your app?
2) How would your app deal with the Github API going down?
3) Did you consider creating a separate branch on your project? What did you do on the other branch?
4) Is your app responsive?
5) Why should I use your app, instead of something that's already out there?
